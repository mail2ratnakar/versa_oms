# Build Process — the canonical loop for every change

This is THE ordered process for any fix/feature. It ties together the other docs; follow it top
to bottom, every time. No ad-hoc code edits, no skipping steps.

Supporting docs (each step links to one):
- `spec/brain/BRAIN_INDEX.md` — the **founder brain** (mindset ABOVE skills/principles: what "complete" means, gap heuristics, bug-fix-as-journey, readiness labels, when to stop) + `spec/brain/FOUNDER_BRAIN_CHECKLIST.md`
- `generators/spec_playbook/config/source_of_truth_schema.json` — the **14 parameters**
- `spec/skills/SKILLS_INDEX.md` — the **skills dictionary** (HOW to read specs/JSONs/canonical for each layer; read the relevant skill before touching that layer) + `spec/skills/SKILL_APPLICATION_CHECKLIST.md`
- `spec/WORKFLOW_CHECKLIST.md` — the per-element data/spec checks
- `spec/PRINCIPLES.md` — the principles dictionary (exhaustive pass)
- `spec/SPEC_DRIVEN_METHOD.md` — the generator pipeline + drift guardrail
- `implementation/CANONICAL_DATA_MODEL.json` — the data source of truth (NOT spec/modules/*/schema.json collections)

## The loop

**0. Request + brain.** The user asks for a fix/feature, or an auditor surfaces a gap. Enter with the founder mindset (`spec/brain/`): "complete" = consequence·visibility·persistence·proof; a bug is a missing layer (feature→actor→screen→API→state→DB→effect→audit→journey), not a symptom to patch; use accurate readiness labels and never claim done without evidence (`FOUNDER_BRAIN_CHECKLIST.md`).

**1. CR.** Write `spec/modules/<m>/feature_requests/FR-<MODULE>-<YEAR>-<NNNN>.json` (from `feature_request_template.json`). One CR per change; it's the record of intent.

**2. 14-parameter row.** Fill the source-of-truth 14 parameters inside the CR (`param_14`):
`question_id · section · question · answer · answer_source · confidence · affected_modules · data_entities · workflow_entities · security_implications · approval_implications · downstream_dependencies · assumptions · needs_user_review`.
This forces the modules/data/workflow grounding + the risk surface (security/approval/downstream) up front. **`downstream_dependencies` is where hidden work hides** (e.g. "the list must filter server-side") — fill it honestly.

**3. Load the relevant skill(s) (skills dictionary).** Before reading or writing ANY spec, `*.json`, screen, migration, or `CANONICAL_DATA_MODEL.json` for this change, open `spec/skills/SKILLS_INDEX.md` and read the skill(s) whose layer the current action touches — i.e. match the files/folders you're about to touch to skills:
   - data / canonical / `schema.json` → `01 Spec Interpreter` + `06 Database Migration`
   - an action's after-effects (`workflows.json`, `chains.json`, tasks, notifications, audit) → `02 Effect Chain` + `09 Audit Idempotency`
   - a screen / `screens.json` / `ModuleTable` → `03 Screen Contract` + `13 UI Design System`
   - routes / actions spec / envelopes → `05 API Contract`
   - auth / scope / `security.json` / masking → `07 Auth RBAC Scope` + `08 Security Privacy`
   - files / signed URLs → `10`; async/workers → `11`; observability → `12`; seed/tests → `14`
   State which skills you read and which of their checks are satisfied; if a check can't be met, STOP and report the gap (`17 Gap Detection`) rather than improvising. No coding before the relevant skills are applied (`spec/skills/SKILL_APPLICATION_CHECKLIST.md`).

**4. Check the modules + their JSONs.** For each `affected_module`, read its own files — `workflows.json`, `lifecycle_states.json`, `security.json`, `*_policy.json`, `*_field_policy.json`, `schema.json` (for intent), `screens.json` — AGAINST `CANONICAL_DATA_MODEL.json` (the real columns/types/nullability). Run `check_schema_drift.py` + `audit_modules.py`. (= `WORKFLOW_CHECKLIST.md` steps 1–2.)

**5. Principles pass (exhaustive).** Run `PRINCIPLES.md` against EVERY element of the change (every field/column/action/filter). **Show the user the per-element field→control→verdict table** before any code (P0.4).

**6. Approve.** User approves the feature set + resolves any `needs_user_review` items. Only then proceed.

**7. Implement — spec-first.** Edit the SPEC (screen/actions/schema/workflow/effect), then regenerate with `gen_*.py`. Never hand-edit generated output (`// GENERATED … DO NOT EDIT`). Reuse existing schema/enums; avoid needless migrations (P0.5).

**8. Tests — functional + security + concurrency (P4.6).** Enumerate the units of the feature and write + run a test for EACH across three dimensions: (a) **functional** (each filter, pill, pagination, empty state, a record rendering past page 1, scope, masking); (b) **security (OWASP)** (access-control/IDOR, fail-closed guards, injection/input validation, mass-assignment/forbidden-field rejection, sensitive-data masking, idempotency conflict); (c) **concurrency** (concurrent transitions from one from-state, idempotency-key replay, dual-approval double-submit, parallel unique-code inserts). Fix bugs as they surface. Counts being right ≠ records being visible. Record every test in `spec/TEST_REGISTRY.md` (P4.7).

**9. Verify.** `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npx vitest run` + the JRN e2e (positive + a fail-closed negative) + `check_generated.py` (drift guardrail, on a clean tree) + the auditor reflects the change.

**10. Commit.** CR + spec + generated output + tests together, with a message that names the CR.

**11. Update status everywhere (MANDATORY — founder rule 2026-06-25).** A loop is not done until status is current in ALL of:
   - **Persistent memory** — `.claude/projects/.../memory/versa-oms-state-of-build.md` (one concise dated entry per CR) + its `MEMORY.md` index line. This is what a restart reads.
   - **Build log** — append a dated row to `reports/BUILD_LOG.md` (chronological per-CR: what shipped + verify evidence + deferred).
   - **Build status snapshot** — `reports/BUILD_STATUS.md` (current-state: tests/migrations/recently-completed).
   - **Audit reports** — the auditor outputs that changed (`reports/MODULE_GAP_AUDIT.md` via `audit_modules.py`; update `reports/SPEC_VS_BUILT_GAP.md` readiness when a module's gap closes).
   - **Session handoff** — `.remember/remember.md` (next-session continuation pointer).
   Never leave status stale; "status updated everywhere" is part of the definition of done (P0.7).

## Why each step exists (learned the hard way)
- **Load the relevant skill(s)** — the skills dictionary encodes HOW to read each layer (specs/JSONs/canonical) and what "done" means for it; reading the matching skill before touching that layer prevents improvising behavior the spec already defines (e.g. effects/audit/scope checks skipped because the layer's checklist wasn't consulted).
- **CR + 14-param** — catches downstream work before coding (the CRM toolbar's server-side filtering was found at param 12, not at test time).
- **Canonical, not spec collections** — `verification_url` was read from a spec collection that wasn't a real column.
- **Exhaustive principles pass** — `state` was left as free text while `country`/`board` became dropdowns.
- **Unit tests after** — facet counts were right but page-2 records were unreachable (no pagination test).
